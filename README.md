# Document Exporter Kata

The goal of this kata is to refactor the existing code.

Also since we want to produce nice content, we've decided that we'd like to make sure that no one using our exporter creates documents containing bad words and phrases.
For example we'd like the word `bad` to be replaced with `good`, `problem` with `opportunity` etc.  

And not only that, we'd like to add smileys after each paragraph, to make it  even more positive. 

Your job is to add those features. We might even think about more modifications in the future so please be ready for those.
